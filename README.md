This is a project I worked on during my employement at Manulife Securities.

During my time there, they made us use Dynamics365's CRM...
If you know anything about it, then I am sorry for the countless time lost waiting for search results to load, for call logs to be completed and all of the other issues 
that comes with its usage.

I created this basic tool to try to use the Dynamics365's crm as little as possible while still complying to my company's code of conduct.
